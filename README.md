# Improvise-a-Jazz-Solo

## Coursera - RNN Programming Assignment

### Description of experiment

Welcome! In this notebook, we will implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. 
At the end, we'll even be able to listen to your own music!

By the end of this assignment, we'll be able to:

1. Apply an LSTM to a music generation task <br>
2. Generate your own jazz music with deep learning <br>
3. Use the flexible Functional API to create complex models <br>
4. This is going to be a fun one. Let's get started! <br>
